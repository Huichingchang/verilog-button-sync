# Verilog Button Synchronizer

This project implements a **two-flip-flop synchronizer** for external asynchronous button inputs to a synchronous system clock domain in Verilog.

## 🧠 Design Overview

- External **asynchronous** button input (`btn_in`) might cause **metastability** if sampled directly by system clock.
- To solve this, a **2-stage synchronizer** is used:
  - First flip-flop (sync_ff1) captures the asynchronous signal.
  - Second flip-flop (sync_ff2) synchronizes it to the system clock.
  - Final output (`btn_sync`) is stable and safe.

## 🌊 Waveform

**Observation:**
- When `btn_in` toggles, `btn_sync` changes after **two clock cycles**.
- It ensures stable transition into clock domain and avoids metastability.
